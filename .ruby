summary: Setup.rb as a stand-alone application.
version: 5.1.0
name: setup
title: Setup
description: ! 'Every Rubyist is aware of Minero Aoki''s ever useful

  setup.rb script. It''s how most of us used to install

  our ruby programs before RubyGems came along.And it''s

  still mighty useful in certain scenarios, not the least

  of which is the job of the distribution package managers.

  Setup converts setup.rb into a stand-alone application.

  No longer will you need distribute setup.rb with you

  Ruby packages. Just instruct your users to use Setup.'
