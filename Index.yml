title: Setup
summary: Setup.rb as a stand-alone application

description:
  Every Rubyist is aware of Minero Aoki's ever useful
  setup.rb script. It's how most of us used to install
  our ruby programs before RubyGems came along. And it's
  still mighty useful in certain scenarios, not the least
  of which is the job of the distribution package managers.
  Setup converts setup.rb into a stand-alone application.
  No longer will you need distribute setup.rb with you
  Ruby packages. Just instruct your users to use Setup.
