This release makes a couple of important changes. First the `.ruby` file is no
longer the supported metadata file. While the format is basically the same,
the file is now called `.index`. See the {Indexer}[http://github.com/rubyworks/indexer]
project for more details. One can still use `.setup/name`, `.setup/version`
and `.setup/loadpath` files instead. In addition, `.setup/testrc.rb` has been
renamed to `.setup/test.rb`, and for shell-based command use `.setup/test.sh`.
